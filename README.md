### Week 4 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
Users play the casino game Blackjack.

## How to Use This Program
A Blackjack game has a minimum of two participants: the dealer, and at least one
player (up to 8). The objective of Blackjack is to reach a score of 21. Players
are dealt two regular playing cards, each with a value corresponding to the rank.
The user can "hit" to be dealt another card, or "stay" to keep their current
hand unchanged. If a player's score exceeds 21 ("bust") they lose their bet and
are removed from the round. The round is won when a player reaches 21 or all but
one player goes bust. Not all rounds end in a win.
