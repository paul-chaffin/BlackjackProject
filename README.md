## Blackjack Project

### Week 4 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
Users play the casino game Blackjack.

## How to Use This Program
A Blackjack game has a minimum of two participants: the dealer, and at least one
player (up to 8). The objective of Blackjack is to reach a score of 21. Players
are dealt two regular playing cards, each with a value corresponding to the rank.
The user can "hit" to be dealt another card, or "stay" to keep their current
hand unchanged. If a player's score exceeds 21 ("bust") they lose their bet and
are removed from the round. The round is won when a player reaches 21 or all but
one player goes bust. Not all rounds end in a win.

## Lessons Learned
The OO aspect of this project was simpler to implement than other aspects. I ran
into the most static between the multiple loops running in the program, and
properly passing information to methods between those loops. Determining where
in the flow to place condition checks stopped me up for quite a while, and even
then I had to revisit them to clean them up.
